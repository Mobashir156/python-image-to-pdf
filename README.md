This project is a simple GUI application built with Tkinter in Python. It allows users to convert multiple image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) into a single PDF file. Users can select images using a file dialog, specify an output PDF name, and then click a button to perform the conversion. The application uses the ReportLab library to generate the PDF file and the Pillow library to handle image processing. It provides a straightforward interface for converting images to PDFs efficiently.
